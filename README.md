Attention-based Mean-max Balance Assignment for Oriented Object Detection in Optical Remote Sensing Images
Paper link:https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10852329

Introduction

The source code includes BFPA module and MMBA strategy for the proposed method of the paper "Attention-based Mean-max Balance Assignment for Oriented Object Detection in Optical Remote Sensing Images".

The the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified on two baseline methods. Corresponding source code and configurations reside in following two sub-directories:

RetinanNet: the implementation and verification using RetinanNet as baseline;
S2a-Net: the implementation and verification using s2anet(https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9377550) as baseline.
For the complete code framework, please refer to the MMrotate 1.x version. The specific installation steps and documentation link are as follows: (https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmrotate/tree/1.x). This repository only provides our core code, and the directory structure is shown above.


Please refer to the README.md file in each sub-directory for the detailed instructions of usage.
